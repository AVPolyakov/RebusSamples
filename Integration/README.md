## Integration

This sample shows how Rebus can be used with a request/reply pattern to make communication with an external web service more robust.

The point is that the web service only succeeds in doing its job 1/3 of the times it is called, and thus - if we dependended on it directly - it would make our lives miserable.

Hiding it behind a wall of asynchronous reliable messaging with retries is just infinitely useful in scenarios like this.

In order to run this sample, make the following projects be startup projects:

	IntegrationSample.Client
	IntegrationSample.IntegrationService
	IntegrationSample.ExternalWebService
